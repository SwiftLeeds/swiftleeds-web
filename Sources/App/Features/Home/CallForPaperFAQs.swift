We also allow talks on design, architecture, working in software, indie development, testing, and more.",

Our team of volunteers each get randomly served three anonymous talks at a time and must rank them. At this stage we do not see who the speaker is, but only the title and description you provide.",

            "With this ranking we work from the top and remove any duplicate talks, and additional talks from the same speaker. We'll then reach out to the top speakers to confirm their attendance, simply working down the list until we have the right number to fill our spots.",

            "This is no problem. You'll be given an invitation letter to upload for the UK VISA application, and we have had substantial success rates with this.",

            "As you can imagine, reviewing over 150 proposals is incredibly time-consuming, and we make sure that everyone is given a fair evaluation so that this process can take time.",
            "However, after CfP closes (at the end of April), it's our mission to start the evaluation, and we'll usually begin letting speakers know in May & June.",
